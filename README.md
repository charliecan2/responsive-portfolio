# Responsive Portfolio
## Description
In this project, I decided to develop a portfolio page where I, and others, can keep track of the projects I have worked on throughout the course of my career. Having a place where I can monitor my progress seems essential as a Developer. It'd also be nice to look back at how my earlier, and even later works, have turned out over time. 

Not only did I develop a Portfolio page, I also included an About section where interested parties can learn about me, the Developer, and a Contact page where people can reach out to me should they want to work with me.

## The Process
For all three sections of my page, I decided to incorporate one container and a Jumbotron onto the single row within it. In the single row, I decided that it should take up only 9 column spaces out of 12. In the portfolio page, I felt it necessary to include sub-rows and columns in the Jumbotron for the images to neatly organize them.

The Navbar was not included in the container that held the single row and columns. Reason being, is that it would have made it's width smaller than the full width of the browser. I made sure to include working links that direct the user to the desired section. Also, I managed to figure out how to make the Navbar open when it collapsed as the browser width got smaller. All I had to do was link the javascript code from the Bootstrap site and assign the navbar-toggler class onto the button tag.

## Challenges
One issue I ran into was getting the placeholder images in the Portfolio section to stack ontop of each other as the browser reduced in width. For some reason, the < col-lg-9 > class would only stack them up until a certain point. Then at a certain size, they would simply bleed out of the Jumbotron and overlap the image next to it. To fix this, I used the "img-fluid" class to make the image responsive.

## Takeaways
It was really fun to explore the Bootstrap site to see all it had to offer, and to search for solutions while designing the page the way you'd like it to be. Sometimes, the page wouldn't be as responsive as I'd like for it to have been, but it made for a great learning experience on how to search for solutions. Overall, it was an enjoyable experience to create this page. And I hope to continue to make it more immersive and interactive as I learn more over time.
